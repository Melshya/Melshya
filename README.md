# Hey there!

I’m **Inês Neves**, though you might know me online as **Melshya**, and I’m from **Lisbon, Portugal**.  

I’ve always enjoyed working with computers, which led me to take a **multimedia course**. Along the way, I discovered that what I really enjoyed was **programming**. Since then, I’ve been diving deeper into code and exploring different areas of development.

A bit about me:  
*  I’ve built websites, both **front-end** and **back-end**.  
*  Currently self-learning **Android engineering**, while still exploring new technologies.  
*  Always curious and open to learning something new in the tech world.  
*  I speak **Portuguese**, **English** and **German**.
*  I have an orange cat and I love cats in general. /ᐠ - ˕ -マ
